	  <p><u>Overall Chart:</u> This overall chart depicts the amount of funds Democrats and Republicans has received from Sports teams over the years. The stacked bar charts are plotted based as percentages. They might not sum up to as there were Bipartisan donations (which were ignored) . Different bar charts are grouped together over the years to show irresepctive of the ammount number of times donations were received and the number of sponsors who have donated. They were particualrly grouped because eventhough the amount received by one particular party might be high for that year from a team but the number of sponsors donated for a party from that team might be less compared to other party (This is clearly visible from NBA team during 2018. Eventhough republicans received high amount compared to Democrats the number of sponsors who have donated for Democrats are high). Over each bar chart legends were displayed which depicts overall total of that party for that year and the percentage it has received from the overall donations. Hovering over one of the rectangles (one of the rectangles represent one of the teams for that year) in one chart, displays strokes highlighting rectangles both in Republicans and Democrats charts to avoid confusion for users. Also on hovering on one of the rectangles a comparision chart is displayed on the right to help users get more clear understanding of the donatinos received by breakdown based on team.</p>
	  <p><u>Left Chart (for Democrats):</u>Chart was both exploratory and explanatory. By single view user can get ovearll story (here overall donations Republicans and Democrats has received from sports teams over the years). Highlighting the key elements like showing comparision by breakdown on right (messaging) on hovering over rectangles and on the top of each bar chart showing the legend of overall funds a party has received. As bar charts are ordered based on years users can easily compare the funds parties has received during 2016 elections and during 2020 elections.By showing legends on the right it will be clear for user which team he is looking at when he hovers on particular rectangle and even gets the year by the legend at the bottom. As selecting rectangle from one chart is highlighting correspoindg rectangles on both charts it will avoid any confusion for the user. Overall data is simplified to get a clear picture.</p>
	  <p><u>Right Chart (for Republicans):</u>Right chart is similar to left chart in functionality but displaying informations for Republicans party.Chart was both exploratory and explanatory. By single view user can get ovearll story (here overall donations Republicans and Democrats has received from sports teams over the years). Highlighting the key elements like showing comparision by breakdown on right (messaging) on hovering over rectangles and on the top of each bar chart showing the legend of overall funds a party has received.
